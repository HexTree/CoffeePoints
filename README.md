This is a smartphone app which uses a points system to reward cafe customers who opt to bring in their personal mug.

<b> Non-technical description: </b>

If the customer opts out of using a disposable cup, the cashier will show a badge with a QR code. Using the app, the customer can scan this badge to earn a point. The app keeps track of the user's points.
